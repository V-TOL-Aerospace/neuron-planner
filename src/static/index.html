                                <h4>Survey</h4>
                                <p>Creates a survey feature in the center of view of the <a href="#help-fp-map-interactive">Interactive Map</a>.</p>
                                <p>The survey feature is a mission feature that creates a "lawn-mower' pattern for the aircraft to follow. The created pattern features a number of parallel "lanes" that the aircraft will fly up and down whilst performing the survey. This type of pattern is typically used to perform area surveys or scanning.</p>
                                <p>The survey created on the screen can be adjusted in a similar manner to the <a href="#help-fp-mission-survey">Survey</a> feature.</p>
                                <p>It has the following properties:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Waypoints: Lists the number of waypoints that are required based on the survey settings.</li>
                                    <li>Show ends: Enables the display of the waypoints that are required based on the survey settings.</li>
                                    <li>Altitude: The altitude of the survey relative to ground level at the take-off location.</li>
                                    <li>Spacing: Spacing between each lane of the survey.</li>
                                    <li>Entry: The entry point that will be used as the survey start. This is aligned with the closest corresponding corner point.</li>
                                    <li>Angle: The orientation angle of the lanes relative to North.</li>
                                    <li>Lead-in: An additional distance that the aircraft must travel before it enters the survey pattern on each lane. This is typically used to ensure that fixed-wing aircraft are flying straight and level before they start their path down each lane.</li>
                                    <li>Run-out A: An additional distance that the aircraft must travel as it exits the survey pattern on each lane. This is for odd numbered lanes (e.g. 1, 3, 5, ...). This is typically used to ensure that fixed-wing aircraft do not start turning before the last survey point for that lane has been taken.</li>
                                    <li>Run-out B: This parameter provides the same function a "Run-out A", but for even numbered lanes (e.g. 2, 4, 6, ...).</li>
                                    <li>Lane Skip: Causes the aircraft to "skip" a specific number of consecutive lanes in the survey pattern, coming back to the intermediate lanes later in the survey. This is typically used for fixed-wing aircraft with a large turning radius.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The survey feature also provides an interface for setting the survey properties through imagery capture requirements and camera information. It is assumed that the camera is oriented such that the height axis points forward on the drone, and that the drone will fly in the direction of travel.</p>
                                <p>The camera calculations require the following properties:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ground Sampling Distance: The captured detail of the ground as a measure of distance per pixel on the final image. Lower values indicate a higher detail survey.</li>
                                    <li>Sidelap: Amount of overlap in the imagery that will be captured between a pair of lanes. Typically, photogrammetry software requires an overlap greater than 50% to perform accurate stitching.</li>
                                    <li>Overlap: Amount of overlap in the imagery that will be captured between sequential images. Typically, photogrammetry software requires a overlap greater than 50% to perform accurate stitching.</li>
                                    <li>Camera: A listing of camera information for cameras that are typically used for surveying. Custom entry of camera information is also permitted.</li>
                                    <li>Focal Length: Focal length of the lense that will be fitted to the camera on the aircraft.</li>
                                    <li>Sensor Width: Physical width of the imagery sensor camera on the aircraft.</li>
                                    <li>Sensor Height: Physical height of the imagery sensor of the camera on the aircraft.</li>
                                    <li>Image Width: Number of pixels in the width axis of the imagery sensor of the camera on the aircraft.</li>
                                    <li>Image Height: Number of pixels in the height axis of the imagery sensor of the camera on the aircraft.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The imagery capture requirements mentioned above will be automatically updated if a valid camera is selected and the survey properties are adjusted. As such, the imagery capture requirements can be used to cross check survey outcomes after adjusting the survey to meet flight limitations.</p>
